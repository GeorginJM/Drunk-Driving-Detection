This is only the code that can be used for creation of an ML model for drunk driving detection. This code consists of feature selection of varying visual determinants of drunkeness, the weights of which can be adjusted. Machine learning, Deep Learning and CNN techniques were used for the creation of the model with Tensorflow. A RAM of 16GB is requi
